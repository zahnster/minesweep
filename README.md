# Minesweeper
### A programming exercise

This is an early version of a Minesweeper game, written in React.

## Setting up and running dev environment
This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Clone the project down locally, cd into it, and run 'npm install' to get all required packages installed. Then you can run dev with the following script:
```
npm start
```

Once running, a browser should open automatically to http://localhost:3000.
